//prelude has all the built in functionality so we dont have to import it, instead we can directly use the rust standard library with functions like fn and println
use std::io
fn main() {
  let mut input = String::new(); //creating new empty string object
  io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).expect("failed to read line"); // :: this is path separator operator so it separtes the packages and modules, like package::module::func
  // the above line is allowing us to change the input which is stored in new string(which is empty now) and store it which is read by io::stdin()
  println!("{}", input);
}
