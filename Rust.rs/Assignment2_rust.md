**Questions**
**Part 1: Integers** 
fn compute(a: u32, b: u32) -> u32 {
    // TODO: change the line below to fix the compiler error and make the tests pass.
    a + b * 4u8
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use crate::compute;

    #[test]
    fn case() {
        assert_eq!(compute(1, 2), 9);
    }
}

**Answer**
**Explanation:** We have to change u8 to u32 as implicit conversion is not allowed in rust
fn compute(a: u32, b: u32) -> u32 {
    // Converting 4u8 to u32 to match the type of 'b'
    a + b * 4u32
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use crate::compute;

    #[test]
    fn case() {
        assert_eq!(compute(1, 2), 9);
    }
}

**Part 2: Variables**
// ðŸ‘‡ The lines below, starting with `///`, are called **documentation comments**.
//    They attach documentation to the item that follows them. In this case, the `speed` function.
//    If you run `cargo doc --open` from this exercise's directory, Rust will generate
//    HTML documentation from these comments and open it in your browser.

/// Given the start and end points of a journey, and the time it took to complete it,
/// calculate the average speed.
pub fn speed(start: u32, end: u32, time_elapsed: u32) -> u32 {
    // TODO: define a variable named `distance` with the right value to get tests to pass
    //  Do you need to annotate the type of `distance`? Why or why not?

    // Don't change the line below
    distance / time_elapsed
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use crate::speed;

    #[test]
    fn case1() {
        assert_eq!(speed(0, 10, 10), 1);
    }

    #[test]
    fn case2() {
        assert_eq!(speed(10, 30, 10), 2);
    }

    #[test]
    fn case3() {
        assert_eq!(speed(10, 31, 10), 2);
    }
}

**Answer**
**Explanation:** Distance is simply the difference between the end and start points.
/// Given the start and end points of a journey, and the time it took to complete it,
/// calculate the average speed.
pub fn speed(start: u32, end: u32, time_elapsed: u32) -> u32 {
    // Calculate the distance
    let distance = end - start;

    // Don't change the line below
    distance / time_elapsed
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use crate::speed;

    #[test]
    fn case1() {
        assert_eq!(speed(0, 10, 10), 1);
    }

    #[test]
    fn case2() {
        assert_eq!(speed(10, 30, 10), 2);
    }

    #[test]
    fn case3() {
        assert_eq!(speed(10, 31, 10), 2);
    }
}

**Part 3: if else**
/// Return `true` if `n` is even, `false` otherwise.
fn is_even(n: u32) -> bool {
    todo!()
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use crate::is_even;

    #[test]
    fn one() {
        assert!(!is_even(1));
    }

    #[test]
    fn two() {
        assert!(is_even(2));
    }

    #[test]
    fn high() {
        assert!(!is_even(231));
    }
}

**Answer**
**Explanation:** n % 2 == 0 checks whether n is divisible by 2. If true, the number is even, and the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

fn is_even(n: u32) -> bool {
    n % 2 == 0
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use crate::is_even;

    #[test]
    fn one() {
        assert!(!is_even(1));
    }

    #[test]
    fn two() {
        assert!(is_even(2));
    }

    #[test]
    fn high() {
        assert!(!is_even(231));
    }
}

**Part 4: panics**
/// Given the start and end points of a journey, and the time it took to complete the journey,
/// calculate the average speed of the journey.
fn speed(start: u32, end: u32, time_elapsed: u32) -> u32 {
    // TODO: Panic with a custom message if `time_elapsed` is 0

    (end - start) / time_elapsed
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use crate::speed;

    #[test]
    fn case1() {
        assert_eq!(speed(0, 10, 10), 1);
    }

    #[test]
    // ðŸ‘‡ With the `#[should_panic]` annotation we can assert that we expect the code
    //    under test to panic. We can also check the panic message by using `expected`.
    //    This is all part of Rust's built-in test framework!
    #[should_panic(expected = "The journey took no time at all, that's impossible!")]
    fn by_zero() {
        speed(0, 10, 0);
    }
}

**Answer**
**Explanation:** We can use the panic! macro to write the panic message. The panic! macro in Rust is used to immediately terminate a program when something goes wrong. It triggers a panic at runtime, which is Rustâ€™s way of handling critical errors. When the panic! macro is invoked, the program prints an error message, unwinds the stack (releases resources and cleans up), and then terminates.

fn speed(start: u32, end: u32, time_elapsed: u32) -> u32 {
    // Panic with a custom message if `time_elapsed` is 0
    if time_elapsed == 0 {
        panic!("The journey took no time at all, that's impossible!");
    }

    (end - start) / time_elapsed
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use crate::speed;

    #[test]
    fn case1() {
        assert_eq!(speed(0, 10, 10), 1);
    }

    #[test]
    #[should_panic(expected = "The journey took no time at all, that's impossible!")]
    fn by_zero() {
        speed(0, 10, 0);
    }
}
