In Rust, the **let** keyword is used to declare variables. It's the primary way to introduce a new variable or a binding to a value in a scope. Rust variables are immutable by default, meaning their value cannot be changed unless explicitly made mutable.
2 ways of declaring a variable , let x = 20; // **implicitly** type is decided by compiler or let x: i32 = 20; //explicitly type is given.
let allows you to initialize multiple variables at once. let (carrot,bunnies) = (80,5);
